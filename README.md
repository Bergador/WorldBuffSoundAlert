# WorldBuffSoundAlert

WoW vanilla addon (1.12.1) that will play a sound effect when a world buff yell is registered, seconds before the world buff goes off.

Meant to facilitate scouting for world buffs.

Works for all world buffs (Warchief's Blessing, Rallying Cry of the Dragon Slayer, Spirit of Zandalar), but only on an english lanuage client.

You can hear the sound that will play by pasting the following code snippet into your chat:
/run PlaySoundFile("sound\\interface\\PVPFlagTakenHordeMono.wav")
